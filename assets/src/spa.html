	♡♡ For optimal results, we suggest 4-6 treatments especially for severity damaged skin. With 2-3 peels, blackheads are effectively eliminated. With 6 treatments, mild to moderate acne disappears. More severe classes of acne may take more than 6 treatments ♡♡<br>
	♡♡♡ For the most effective and longlasting results, dermabrasion treatments should be taken in a series, and not standalone. We suggest 5-12 sessions depending on what we are treating specifically and how severe the damage is ♡♡♡</p>
